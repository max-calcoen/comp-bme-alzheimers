    "* Diagnosis ([source](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/medical_tests))\n",
    "    * no single test to evaluate alzheimer's or other dementia\n",
    "    * medical history: history of cognitive and behavioral changes, family history of alzheimer's or other dementia\n",
    "    * physical exam, diagnostic tests: diet, medications, physicals, lab test\n",
    "    * neurological exam: reflexes, coordination, eye movement, speech, sensation\n",
    "    * cognitive, functional and behavioral tests: AD8, SLUMS, IQCODE, FAQ, MMSE\n",
    "    * computerized tests and devices: growing area. includes ANAM, CANTAB, CognICA, Cognigram, Cognivue, Cognision (digital cognitive testing tools)\n",
    "    * depression screen, mood assessment: sense of wellbeing\n",
    "    * genetic testing: certain genes increase risk of alzheimer's and other rare genes (1% or less) that directly cause alzheimer's\n",
    "    * brain imaging: MRI or CT scanes rule out other conditions, or sometimes look directly at beta-amyloid\n",
    "    * cerebrospinal fluid: biomarkers (tau, beta-amyloid, neurofilament light) appear in CSF before brain, still evolving test\n",

    "    * no cure, but various drug and non-drug options for treatment\n",
    "    * drugs that treat symptoms: cognitive symptoms (chrlinesterase inhibitors, glutamate regulators), non-cognitive symptoms (orexin inhibitors), atypical antipsychotics (target serotonin and dopamine chemical pathways)\n",
    "    * drugs that change disease progression: 2 FDA-approved treatments (both anti-amyloid antibody IV infusions)\n",
    "    * as with many neurodegenerative disease, early diagnosis is important (some treatments only effective in early stages of disease). AD is a progressive brain disease: worsens over time (asymptomatic -> mild cognitive impairment -> mild -> moderate -> severe)\n",
    "* Disease progression & prognosis ([source](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/stages))\n",
    "    * 3 stages: early (mild), middle (moderate), and late (severe)\n",
    "    * on average, a person lives 4-8 years after diagnosis\n",
    "    * early stage: may function independently. feel as if they have memory lapses (forgetting words, familiar objects, names, etc)\n",
    "    * middle stage: longest stage, lasts many years. dementia symptoms progress, including memory loss, confusion, trouble controlling bladder/bowels, personality / behavioral changes\n",
    "    * late stage: lose ability to respond to environment, control movement, communication becomes difficult. require assistance with daily personal care, lose awareness, difficulty communicating\n",
    "* Continuum of care providers ([source](https://aspe.hhs.gov/national-plan-address-alzheimers-disease))\n",
    "    * depends on location (country > state > region > city)\n",
    "    * primary and specialized medical providers provide timely and accurate diagnosis, neurologists, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists offer early detection and specialized treatment services\n",
    "    * care coordination and transition services: care coordinators oversee transitions between stages of care (diagnosis to long term management)\n",
    "    * long term support and residential care: assisted-living facilities, continuing care retirement communities, nursing homes (hopefully with dementia-specific protocols)\n",
    "    * support for caregivers and families (educational materials, culturally sensitive support, community based programs)\n",
