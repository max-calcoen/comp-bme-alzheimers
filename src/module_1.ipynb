    "\n",
    "Our findings support the idea that education level is meaningfully associated with tau ratios, but the effect may be most evident in broad contrasts rather than across fine-grained educational subgroups. Ethically, this calls for careful communication of results to avoid stigma- saying “low education causes worse tau pathology” risks stigmatizing individuals and overlooks confounding factors.\n",

    "Additionally, if education is consistently linked to biological or cognitive outcomes (including AD), then public health/policy efforts should focus on reducing disparities. For example, they should focus on promoting lifelong learning, access to healthcare, cognitive enrichment activities, known factors that reduce neurodegenerative risk."

    "One limitation of our project is that we were working with a relatively small dataset, which made it harder to draw strong conclusions. With fewer samples, individual outliers or unusual cases may have had a bigger effect on the results. In the future, it would be valuable to use a larger longitudinal study, which would lessen the influence of outliers and make the results less prone to bias. Tracking tau buildup over time would also make it possible to compare more directly with what the literature shows."
